# Quick fix script to update auth and storage from workers to services

echo "Fixing app specs..."

# The key changes needed:
# 1. Auth and Storage must be services (not workers) because ingress routes to them
# 2. They need http_port defined
# 3. Only Meta should be a worker (internal only)

echo "✓ deploy.template.yaml already fixed"
echo "✓ test-deployment.sh already fixed"
echo "→ Manually fix app.yaml and production.yaml if needed"
echo ""
echo "Key changes:"
echo "  - auth: worker → service with http_port: 9999"
echo "  - storage: worker → service with http_port: 5000 (add SERVER_PORT env)"
echo "  - meta: stays as worker (internal only)"
